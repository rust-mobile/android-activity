## [Unreleased]

- input: Replaced custom types with their `ndk` crate equivalent.
  > [!NOTE]
  > These types existed because the `ndk` crate didn't provide them in an extensible way.  Now that they have the `#[non_exhaustive]` flag and contain a `__Unknown(T)` variant to provide lossless conversions, and not to mention use an ABI type that matches how it is being used by most functions (when the original constants were defined in a "typeless" way), the `ndk` types are used and reexported once again.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > **Relevant breaking changes**:
  > - `repr()` types for some `enum`s have changed to match the ABI type that is used by most functions that are returning or consuming this wrapper type.
  > - `Source::is_xxx_class()` functions are replaced by querying `Source::class()` and comparing against variants from the returned `SourceClass` `bitflags` enum.
  > - `SourceFlags::TRACKBALL` (from `Source::is_trackball_class()`) is named `SourceClass::NAVIGATION` in the `ndk`.

## [0.6.0] - 2024-04-26

### Changed
- rust-version bumped to 1.69.0 ([#156](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/156))
- Upgrade to `ndk-sys 0.6.0` and `ndk 0.9.0` ([#155](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/155))

### Fixed
- Check for null `saved_state_in` pointer from `NativeActivity`

## [0.5.2] - 2024-01-30

### Fixed
- NativeActivity: OR with `EVENT_ACTION_MASK` when extracting action from `MotionEvent` - fixing multi-touch input ([#146](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/issues/146), [#147](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/147))

## [0.5.1] - 2023-12-20

### Changed
- Avoids depending on default features for `ndk` crate to avoid pulling in any `raw-window-handle` dependencies ([#142](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/142))

  **Note:** Technically, this could be observed as a breaking change in case you
  were depending on the `rwh_06` feature that was enabled by default in the
  `ndk` crate. This could be observed via the `NativeWindow` type (exposed via
  `AndroidApp::native_window()`) no longer implementing `rwh_06::HasWindowHandle`.

  In the unlikely case that you were depending on the `ndk`'s `rwh_06` API
  being enabled by default via `android-activity`'s `ndk` dependency, your crate
  should explicitly enable the `rwh_06` feature for the `ndk` crate.

  As far as could be seen though, it's not expected that anything was
  depending on this (e.g. anything based on Winit enables the `ndk` feature
  based on an equivalent `winit` feature).

  The benefit of the change is that it can help avoid a redundant
  `raw-window-handle 0.6` dependency in projects that still need to use older
  (non-default) `raw-window-handle` versions. (Though note that this may be
  awkward to achieve in practice since other crates that depend on the `ndk`
  are still likely to use default features and also pull in
  `raw-window-handles 0.6`)

- The IO thread now gets named `stdio-to-logcat` and main thread is named `android_main` ([#145](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/145))
- Improved IO error handling in `stdio-to-logcat` IO loop. ([#133](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/133))

## [0.5.0] - 2023-10-16
### Added
- Added `MotionEvent::action_button()` exposing the button associated with button press/release actions ([#138](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/138))

### Changed
- rust-version bumped to 0.68 ([#123](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/123))
- *Breaking*: updates to `ndk 0.8` and `ndk-sys 0.5` ([#128](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/128))
- The `Pointer` and `PointerIter` types from the `ndk` crate are no longer directly exposed in the public API ([#122](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/122))
- All input API enums based on Android SDK enums have been made runtime extensible via hidden `__Unknown(u32)` variants ([#131](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/131))

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2023-08-15
### Changed
- Pulled in `ndk-sys 0.5.0-beta.0` and `ndk 0.8.0-beta.0` ([#113](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/113))

## [0.5.0-beta.0] - 2023-08-15

### Added
- Added `KeyEvent::meta_state()` for being able to query the state of meta keys, needed for character mapping ([#102](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/102))
- Added `KeyCharacterMap` JNI bindings to the corresponding Android SDK API ([#102](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/102))
- Added `AndroidApp::device_key_character_map()` for being able to get a `KeyCharacterMap` for a given `device_id` for unicode character mapping ([#102](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/102))

    <summary>Click here for an example of how to handle unicode character mapping:</summary>

    ```rust
    let mut combining_accent = None;
    // Snip


    let combined_key_char = if let Ok(map) = app.device_key_character_map(device_id) {
        match map.get(key_event.key_code(), key_event.meta_state()) {
            Ok(KeyMapChar::Unicode(unicode)) => {
                let combined_unicode = if let Some(accent) = combining_accent {
                    match map.get_dead_char(accent, unicode) {
                        Ok(Some(key)) => {
                            info!("KeyEvent: Combined '{unicode}' with accent '{accent}' to give '{key}'");
                            Some(key)
                        }
                        Ok(None) => None,
                        Err(err) => {
                            log::error!("KeyEvent: Failed to combine 'dead key' accent '{accent}' with '{unicode}': {err:?}");
                            None
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    info!("KeyEvent: Pressed '{unicode}'");
                    Some(unicode)
                };
                combining_accent = None;
                combined_unicode.map(|unicode| KeyMapChar::Unicode(unicode))
            }
            Ok(KeyMapChar::CombiningAccent(accent)) => {
                info!("KeyEvent: Pressed 'dead key' combining accent '{accent}'");
                combining_accent = Some(accent);
                Some(KeyMapChar::CombiningAccent(accent))
            }
            Ok(KeyMapChar::None) => {
                info!("KeyEvent: Pressed non-unicode key");
                combining_accent = None;
                None
            }
            Err(err) => {
                log::error!("KeyEvent: Failed to get key map character: {err:?}");
                combining_accent = None;
                None
            }
        }
    } else {
        None
    };
    ```

    </details>

### Changed
- GameActivity updated to 2.0.2 (requires the corresponding 2.0.2 `.aar` release from Google) ([#88](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/88))
- `AndroidApp::input_events()` is replaced by `AndroidApp::input_events_iter()` ([#102](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/102))

    <details>
    <summary>Click here for an example of how to use `input_events_iter()`:</summary>

    ```rust
    match app.input_events_iter() {
        Ok(mut iter) => {
            loop {
                let read_input = iter.next(|event| {
                    let handled = match event {
                        InputEvent::KeyEvent(key_event) => {
                            // Snip
                        }
                        InputEvent::MotionEvent(motion_event) => {
                            // Snip
                        }
                        event => {
                            // Snip
                        }
                    };

                    handled
                });

                if !read_input {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        Err(err) => {
            log::error!("Failed to get input events iterator: {err:?}");
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

## [0.4.3] - 2023-07-30
### Fixed
- Fixed a deadlock in the `native-activity` backend while waiting for the native thread after getting an `onDestroy` callback from Java ([#94](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/94))
- Fixed numerous deadlocks in the `game-activity` backend with how it would wait for the native thread in various Java callbacks, after the app has returned from `android_main` ([#98](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/98))

## [0.4.2] - 2023-06-17
### Changed
- The `Activity.finish()` method is now called when `android_main` returns so the `Activity` will be destroyed ([#67](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/issues/67))
- The `native-activity` backend now propagates `NativeWindow` redraw/resize and `ContentRectChanged` callbacks to main loop ([#70](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/70))
- The `game-activity` implementation of `pointer_index()` was fixed to not always return `0` ([#80](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/84))
- Added `panic` guards around application's `android_main()` and native code that could potentially unwind across a Java FFI boundary ([#68](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/68))

## [0.4.1] - 2023-02-16
### Added
- Added `AndroidApp::vm_as_ptr()` to expose JNI `JavaVM` pointer ([#60](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/issues/60))
- Added `AndroidApp::activity_as_ptr()` to expose Android `Activity` JNI reference as pointer ([#60](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/issues/60))
### Changed

### Removed
- Most of the examples were moved to <https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples> ([#50](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/50))

## [0.4.0] - 2022-11-10
### Changed
- *Breaking*: `input_events` callback now return whether an event was handled or not to allow for fallback handling ([#31](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/issues/31))
- The native-activity backend is now implemented in Rust only, without building on `android_native_app_glue.c` ([#35](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/35))
### Added
- Added `Pointer::tool_type()` API to `GameActivity` backend for compatibility with `ndk` events API ([#38](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/38))

## [0.3.0] - 2022-09-15
### Added
- `show/hide_sot_input` API for being able to show/hide a soft keyboard (other IME still pending)
- `set_window_flags()` API for setting WindowManager params
### Changed
- *Breaking*: Created extensible, `#[non_exhaustive]` `InputEvent` wrapper enum instead of exposing `ndk` type directly

## [0.2.0] - 2022-08-25
### Added
- Emit an `InputAvailable` event for new input with `NativeActivity` and `GameActivity`
  enabling gui apps that don't render continuously
- Oboe and Cpal audio examples added
- `AndroidApp` is now `Send` + `Sync`
### Changed
