# 1.69 was when Rust last updated the Android NDK version used to build the
# standard library which avoids needing the -lunwind workaround in build tools.

# We depend on cargo-ndk for building which has dropped support for the above
# linker workaround.

[features]
# Note: we don't enable any backend by default since features
# are generally supposed to be additive, while these backends
# are actually mutually exclusive.
#
# In general it's only the final application crate that needs
# to decide on a backend.
