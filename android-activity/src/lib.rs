//! A glue layer for building standalone, Rust applications on Android
//!
//! This crate provides a "glue" layer for building native Rust
//! applications on Android, supporting multiple [`Activity`] base classes.
//! It's comparable to [`android_native_app_glue.c`][ndk_concepts]
//! for C/C++ applications.
//!
//! Currently the crate supports two `Activity` base classes:
//! 1. [`NativeActivity`] - Built in to Android, this doesn't require compiling any Java or Kotlin code.
//! 2. [`GameActivity`] - From the Android Game Development Kit, it has more
//!    sophisticated input handling support than `NativeActivity`. `GameActivity`
//!    is also based on the `AndroidAppCompat` class which can help with supporting
//!    a wider range of devices.
//!
//! Standalone applications based on this crate need to be built as `cdylib` libraries, like:
//! ```
//! [lib]
//! crate_type=["cdylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! and implement a `#[no_mangle]` `android_main` entry point like this:
//! ```rust
//! #[no_mangle]
//! fn android_main(app: AndroidApp) {
//!
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Once your application's `Activity` class has loaded and it calls `onCreate` then
//! `android-activity` will spawn a dedicated thread to run your `android_main` function,
//! separate from the Java thread that created the corresponding `Activity`.
//!
//! [`AndroidApp`] provides an interface to query state for the application as
//! well as monitor events, such as lifecycle and input events, that are
//! marshalled between the Java thread that owns the `Activity` and the native
//! thread that runs the `android_main()` code.
//!
//! # Cheaply Clonable [`AndroidApp`]
//!
//! [`AndroidApp`] is intended to be something that can be cheaply passed around
//! by referenced within an application. It is reference counted and can be
//! cheaply cloned.
//!
//! # `Send` and `Sync` [`AndroidApp`]
//!
//! Although an [`AndroidApp`] implements `Send` and `Sync` you do need to take
//! into consideration that some APIs, such as [`AndroidApp::poll_events()`] are
//! explicitly documented to only be usable from your `android_main()` thread.
//!
//! # Main Thread Initialization
//!
//! Before `android_main()` is called, the following application state
//! is also initialized:
//!
//! 1. An I/O thread is spawned that will handle redirecting standard input
//!    and output to the Android log, visible via `logcat`.
//! 2. A `JavaVM` and `Activity` instance will be associated with the [`ndk_context`] crate
//!    so that other, independent, Rust crates are able to find a JavaVM
//!    for making JNI calls.
//! 3. The `JavaVM` will be attached to the native thread
//! 4. A [Looper] is attached to the Rust native thread.
//!
//!
//! These are undone after `android_main()` returns
//!
//! # Android Extensible Enums
//!
//! There are numerous enums in the `android-activity` API which are effectively
//! bindings to enums declared in the Android SDK which need to be considered
//! _runtime_ extensible.
//!
//! Any enum variants that come from the Android SDK may be extended in future
//! versions of Android and your code could be exposed to new variants if you
//! build an application that might be installed on new versions of Android.
//!
//! This crate follows a convention of adding a hidden `__Unknown(u32)` variant
//! to these enum to ensure we can always do lossless conversions between the
//! integers from the SDK and our corresponding Rust enums. This can be
//! important in case you need to pass certain variants back to the SDK
//! regardless of whether you knew about that variants specific semantics at
//! compile time.
//!
//! You should never include this `__Unknown(u32)` variant within any exhaustive
//! pattern match and should instead treat the enums like `#[non_exhaustive]`
//! enums that require you to add a catch-all for any `unknown => {}` values.
//!
//! Any code that would exhaustively include the `__Unknown(u32)` variant when
//! pattern matching can not be guaranteed to be forwards compatible with new
//! releases of `android-activity` which may add new Rust variants to these
//! enums without requiring a breaking semver bump.
//!
//! You can (infallibly) convert these enums to and from primitive `u32` values
//! using `.into()`:
//!
//! For example, here is how you could ensure forwards compatibility with both
//! compile-time and runtime extensions of a `SomeEnum` enum:
//!
//! ```rust
//! match some_enum {
//!     SomeEnum::Foo => {},
//!     SomeEnum::Bar => {},
//!     unhandled => {
//!         let sdk_val: u32 = unhandled.into();
//!         println!("Unhandled enum variant {some_enum:?} has SDK value: {sdk_val}");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

If you have set one of these features then this error indicates that Cargo is trying to

Since android-activity is responsible for the `android_main` entrypoint of your application
then there can only be a single implementation of android-activity linked with your application.

You can use `cargo tree` (e.g. via `cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a tree`) to identify why multiple
versions have been resolved.

You may need to add a `[patch]` into your Cargo.toml to ensure a specific version of
android-activity is used across all of your application's crates."#
